## Organization:

 - Each set of Todos that I leave myself will be loosely tied to a goal from [plan.md](./plan.md). 
 - There is likely to be some bleed between these goals, as things are rarely built completely linearly. I will try to place these smaller to-dos as tasks of sub-goals where it makes sense. However, I want to also keep a trail of my process that is honest.
